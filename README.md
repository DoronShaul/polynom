# polynom

This repository represents a Polynom built by monoms. 

# features
* simple arithmetic operations(add, subtract, multiply).
* polynom derivative.
* area calculation by riemann's integral method (above the axis-x, and under the function).
* polynom drawing(extreme points and area). stdDraw class used for this method. https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html.
